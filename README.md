# Elevation Plan
We got the chance to design the exterior of the floor plan we made. Although the plans were made for a barndominium, I decided to change the style to more of a ranch style home. It was also inspired somewhat in Pueblo homes. One thing I learned is to check my measurements, since this resulted in later mishaps when it came to doing the section plan. Now I know that these homes are actually built high to make it possible to have normal window heignts.
